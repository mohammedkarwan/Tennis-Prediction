# ðŸŽ¾ Tennis Match Prediction â€“ Value Betting with Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the outcomes of upcoming tennis matches and identifies value bets using live data from a sports API.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To develop an intelligent betting assistant that uses a trained machine learning model to evaluate match odds and identify high-value betting opportunities.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **Live Data Fetching**  
   Retrieves upcoming tennis matches using a sports API (`api-tennis.com`), including players, odds, and match metadata.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Calculates derived features such as `log_odds`, `inverse_odds`, and `risk_index`.  
   - Encodes match level data for model compatibility.

3. **Prediction Model**  
   Loads a pre-trained classification model (`Tennis-Prediction.joblib`) and outputs win probability, expected value (EV), and suggested prediction.

4. **Value Bet Filtering**  
   Highlights only those bets where:
   - Win probability â‰¥ 60%  
   - Expected value â‰¥ 15%  

5. **Result Exporting**  
   Saves high-value betting opportunities to a CSV file for further use.
